# Suspended ticket notification app

This app checks if the requestor of a ticket opened by an agent has any suspended tickets and then provides a notification.

### The following information is displayed:

* The notifications are currently set as placeholders and will need to be changed later
* The per_page variable can be adjusted using the variables at the top of the script to adjust how many tickets are put on each page that is processed.
